# PWA Icons Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files in this directory:

1. icon-72x72.png (72x72 pixels)
2. icon-96x96.png (96x96 pixels)
3. icon-128x128.png (128x128 pixels)
4. icon-144x144.png (144x144 pixels)
5. icon-152x152.png (152x152 pixels)
6. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
7. icon-384x384.png (384x384 pixels)
8. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
9. favicon.ico (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)

These icons should be created with the Unistyles logo and branding.

You can use tools like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma
- Online PWA icon generators

Make sure all icons have the same design but in different sizes to maintain consistency across devices.
